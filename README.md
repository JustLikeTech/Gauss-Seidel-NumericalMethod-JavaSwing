# Gauss-Seidel-NumericalMethod-JavaSwing
This project is a Java Swing application that solves a system of 2 linear equations using the Gauss-Seidel Iterative Method.   It provides a simple graphical interface for input, initial guesses, tolerance, and maximum iterations, then displays iteration results step by step.
